# Volunteer Victoria Canada App
Developed in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile with MVVM, Redux and Clean Architecture. Using SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.

# Requeriments to Run for android

1. Android SDK and the latest stable Android Studio(4.1.3) or IntelliJ(2021.1+)
2. Updated versions of Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile and Intellij Kotlin plugin with 1.4.3x support (should be included in the latest Android Studio or IDEA)
3. JVM 8 and latest JDK
4. Mac with Xcode 12+ (optional if you want to compile for iOs)
5. Cocoa Pods (optional if you are in mac and want to compile for iOs)

Trying to run directly in Android Studio with another version may not be possible since previous 2021.1.1 patches were having issues with kmm.
