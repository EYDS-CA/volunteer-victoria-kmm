# volunteer-victoria-kmm
Volunteer Victoria Canada App developed in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile

# Requeriments to Rum

1. Android Studio Bumblebee 2021.1.1 Patch 3
2. Last versions of Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile and Kotlin Plugins installed in Android Studio
3. XCode preferably 13.2.1 (optional if you are in mac and want to compile for iOs)
4. Cocoa Pods (optional if you are in mac and want to compile for iOs)

Trying to run directly in Android Studio with another configuration may not be possible since previous 2021.1.1 patches were having issues with kmm
